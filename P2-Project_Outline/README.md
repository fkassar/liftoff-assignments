### Overview
Every man, woman, and child needs to eat...

It’s a necessity for life, and as such, most people develop some basic cooking and food preparation skills. Now, we here at the “McDev Cooking Association” can’t turn novice chefs into world-class culinary masters, but we can certainly help address a particular question that every person who steps into a kitchen will have:

“What can I make with the ingredients I have?”

The McDev Cooking Association is proud to present: [Insert witty App name here]; a straightforward and practical tool designed to provide ideas, inspiration, and easy-to-follow recipes for users who have the materials, but not necessarily the know-how, of what to make for their next meal. Simply provide the app with a list of ingredients you have on hand, and the app will search our database of recipes for potential matches for your next meal, complete with step-by-step instructions!

### Features
- User Login [basics] - A basic function to allow users a degree of personalization when using other features of our app.
- CRUD functionality [basics] - Standard app operations to allow the user to provide data to the app to get an expected return datum.
- Ingredients input for returned recipes [mvp] - The heart and soul of our app, the user provides our program with available foodstuffs, and we return to the user, recipe options.
- Filter results (by prep/cook times, extra ingredients, ect) - A feature that allows the user to fine tune their returned results, for better versatility to the user
- Tag system for recipes [mvp] - Some way of tagging the individual ingredients so all recipes on file can be uniformly parsed and handled
- User uploadable recipes - Allow users a degree of interactivity by allowing custom recipes/variations of existing recipes
- Save/favorite recipes option - Allows users to quickly recall preferred recipes (requires user login)

  
### Technologies
In order to implement all the features we are looking to incorporate, we will be utilizing different technologies to achieve our vision. These technologies include:

- SpringBoot Gradle project(for backend development)
- Angular(for frontend development)
- AWS(for deployment)
- MySQL(for data persistence)
- Spoonacular API(for access to data pertaining to recipes and ingredients)

### What I'll Have to Learn
Working as a team through the process of building a program will be a learning experience. The members of the development team will need to learn how to delegate tasks, and support one another.
